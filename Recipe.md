This scrumptious dish is a meal by itself but you can opt to serve it with accompaniments that vary from home to home. I'd recommend a okra pachadi or South Indian-style bhindi raita or potato wafers or even a crispy roast potato palya (stir-fry) with it. If you'd like a healthy option to balance the rich bisi bele bath, try it with the popular Karnataka salad - Kosambari. If ever you try making Bisi Bele Bath at home, you can be sure of fragrant aromas wafting from your kitchen.
